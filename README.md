# Asembler and Emulator (System Software course project)

This repository contains the implementation of a two-pass assembler and an interpretative emulator for a specified processor and computer system, respectively.

### Assembler
Implementation of a two-pass assembler for a specified processor. The assembler should accept arguments through the command line and process a textual file according to defined syntax. The output should be an object program in a textual file, and optionally, a binary file for loading into an emulator. The project requires adherence to specific assembler syntax rules, section definitions, and other functionalities similar to GNU assembler.

### Interpretative Emulator
Implementation of an interpretative emulator for a computer system described in the project. The emulator should be able to process multiple files that are the output of the assembler. It includes requirements like address space loading, section overlap avoidance, and symbol definition handling.
